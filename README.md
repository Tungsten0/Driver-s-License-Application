# Drivers-License-Application
GUI interface using TKinter libraries in Python that would mimic the application for a driver’s license learners permit in Belize

Instructions of Project from CIS 284 GUI Programming with TKinter in Python:
Design a GUI interface using tkinter libraries that would
mimic the application for a driver’s license learners permit in Belize. The
interface should make use of ALL WIDGETS LEARNT in class. Any
graphics or pictures added to the form will be highly favored. Please include
the date of the application to be generated automatically. There should be two
buttons at the end of the form namely “approve” and “deny”. If the “approve”
button is clicked, a pretty print out/report with a header is presented to the
screen using a message box. If the “deny” button is clicked a message that says
“application denied” is printed to the screen using a message box. Attached is
a sample of the Belize City Councils application in .pdf form, use the sample
as a guide for the questions to be placed on the GUI interface.
